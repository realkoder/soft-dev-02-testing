## Quality Management = Quality Assurance + Quality Control

**Quality Assurance (QA) - Proactive**

- Making sure that processes are undertaken correctly

**Quality Control (QC). Reactive**

- Making sure that the desired level of quality is achieved
  - _Testing_ - Enforcement of quality control by finding defects in a product

---

### Verfication vs Validation

**Verification** - Checks that the work product meets the requirements

- Mostly a technical activity
- Verification ensures that we are building the product the right way

**Validation**

- Evaluates the work product against user needs
- Usually requires business knowledge
- Validation checks that we are building the right product

## Testing strategies

### Positive vs Negative Tests

- **Positive Tests:** Verify expected behavior with valid inputs (happy path).
- **Negative Tests:** Verify error handling and graceful degradation with invalid or unexpected inputs.

---

### Static Testing

Testing the code without it being executed.
Could be the IDE highlighting errors - looking at the code / reviewing the code / AI analyzing code.
